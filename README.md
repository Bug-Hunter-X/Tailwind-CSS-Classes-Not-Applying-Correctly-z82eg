# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly.  The problem is likely due to an issue in the build process or conflicting CSS styles that override Tailwind's default styling.

## Bug

The provided code snippet uses standard Tailwind classes (`bg-red-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `p-4`) which should apply background color and padding. However, in the incorrect setup these styles may not be rendered.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that:

1. **Tailwind is correctly configured and built:**  Check your build process to make sure Tailwind's `@tailwind` directives are correctly included in your CSS file and the CSS file is being properly imported into your project.
2. **No conflicting styles:** Check if any other CSS rules are overriding Tailwind's styles. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and check which styles are applied. 
3. **Correct class names:** Double check that the Tailwind class names are correct and match the latest version of Tailwind.
4. **Purge CSS (if applicable):** If you're using PurgeCSS, ensure your configuration correctly includes the necessary components to prevent the purging of classes.

By addressing these points, the Tailwind classes should apply as expected.
